Train drivers will exchange old bronze passes (train passing permits) at this station to approve their passing. Shifen Old Street and Jingan Suspension Bridge near the train station are great tourist attractions to linger and take pictures. The journey walking from Shifen Station to Shifen Scenic Area is a marvelous one, because Shifen Waterfall is right next to the railway. There is a suspension bridge by the side of the railway to enjoy the waterfall. It is a completely different experience to linger on the suspension bridge and enjoy the passing trains. When the train heads for Sandiaoling Station from Shifen Station, you can enjoy the part of the Pingxi Line with the most special geographical features, because all the six tunnels of Pingxi Line are concentrated in this section.","Tel":"886-2-24958307","Add":"No.51, Shifen St., Pingxi Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan 226","Zipcode":"226","Travellinginfo":"","Opentime":"Open all year round&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;","Map":"","Gov":"382000000A","Px":"121.77514","Py":"25.04102","Orgclass":"","Class1":"18","Class2":"","Class3":"","Level":"","Website":"","Parkinginfo":"","Parkinginfo_px":"","Parkinginfo_py":"","Ticketinfo":"","Remarks":"","Keyword":"","Changetime":"2019/03/31 14:27:51"},{"Id":"E1_382000000A_111592","Name":"Shifen Waterfall","Zone":"","Toldescribe":"Shifen Waterfall is a curtain style waterfall.

It was originally constructed as a three-layered iron bridge, but later due to mining industry needs, it was rebuilt to be a reinforced concrete circular arch bridge in August 1965, and was formally named “Grand Ruisan Bridge”. Currently, a completely preserved historic site is still available for tourists to revisit the flourishing mining scenes in the old days. In July, 2010, the Coal Transporting Bridge was refurbished on the flooring so that visitors are able to walk on the Bridge in a safer way. An old-time railroad has also been restored so it is presented in a retro look that mimics closer to its original appearance. Mine cart is also placed on the Bridge to fully display the coal transporting sight in the old days.
